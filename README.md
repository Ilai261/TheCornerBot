# TheCornerBot

A little discord bot I made for me and my friends server, that allows you to put people in the "corner" (HaPina, a channel dedicated for this purpose) 
when they misbehave :)
In order to make the bot work in your server, you'd have to implement the tokens of your server, a few ips in the code and the voice channels ids.
You can put otehr users in the corner once in 3 days for each user.
